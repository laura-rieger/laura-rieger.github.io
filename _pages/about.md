My research focus is interpretability of deep neural networks. Recently I am becoming more interested in ways to utilize explanations, e.g. for [increasing predictive accuracy](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.13584).

Currently I am a PhD student at the [Section for Cognitive Systems](https://www.compute.dtu.dk/english/research/research-sections/cogsys), at the [Technical University of Denmark](https://www.dtu.dk/english) under the supervision of [Lars Kai Hansen](http://cogsys.imm.dtu.dk/staff/lkhansen/lkhansen.html). 
During my PhD studies I visited [Bin Yu's group](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~yugroup/)  at UC Berkeley for six months. 
Previously I obtained my dual master's degree in Computer Science from [TU Berlin](https://www.tu-berlin.de/menue/home/parameter/en/) and [KAIST](http://www.kaist.edu/html/en/index.html), writing my master's thesis in [Klaus-Robert MÃ¼llers group](https://www.ml.tu-berlin.de/menue/machine_learning/) at TU Berlin.
Before that I obtained my bachelor's degree from TU Berlin in Computational Engineering Science.
