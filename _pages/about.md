I am a postdoctoral researcher at the group for [Atomic Scale Materials Modelling](https://www.asm.energy.dtu.dk/) at DTU Energy in Denmark. My research is focussed on using  deep learning algorithms, particularly generative algorithms, to predict reactions and processes in the physical sciences. In the [BIG-MAP](https://www.big-map.eu/) project, this is used in the context of inverse material design to speed up the discovery and development of new battery materials. 

I recently finished my  PhD  at the [Section for Cognitive Systems](https://www.compute.dtu.dk/english/research/research-sections/cogsys), at the [Technical University of Denmark](https://www.dtu.dk/english) under the supervision of [Lars Kai Hansen](http://cogsys.imm.dtu.dk/staff/lkhansen/lkhansen.html) in October 2020.
During my PhD studies I visited [Bin Yu's group](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~yugroup/)  at UC Berkeley for six months. 
Previously I obtained my dual master's degree in Computer Science from [TU Berlin](https://www.tu-berlin.de/menue/home/parameter/en/) and [KAIST](http://www.kaist.edu/html/en/index.html), writing my master's thesis in [Klaus-Robert MÃ¼llers group](https://www.ml.tu-berlin.de/menue/machine_learning/) at TU Berlin.
Before that I obtained my bachelor's degree from TU Berlin in Computational Engineering Science.
